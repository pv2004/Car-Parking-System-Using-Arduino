# Car-Parking-System-Using-Arduino
Arduino-based smart car parking system using IR sensors, an LCD display, and a servo motor to monitor and manage available parking slots.

IOT project.

-This Arduino-based car parking system uses IR sensors to detect vehicle presence in parking slots. An LCD display shows the availability of slots, and a servo motor controls the entrance gate. The system automatically updates slot availability as cars enter and exit.

Components Used:
-Servo Motor
-Arduino Uno R3
-Jumper Wires
-IR Sensor
-LCD

Libraries:
- LiquidCrystal_I2C.h
- Servo.h
- wire.h
